## Session 1: SanguiShop Phase 1 Foundation Scaffold

**Date**: 2026-04-29
**Task**: `phase-1-foundation`
**Branch**: `main`

### Summary

Built the first-phase SanguiShop foundation scaffold with Maven multi-module structure, common technical modules, service shells, local dependency placeholders, and documentation.

### Main Changes

- Added the root Maven parent project and module aggregation for `common/` and `services/`.
- Added common modules for API envelopes, error codes, tracing, JWT claim constants, Redis key naming, MQ event envelopes, and observability field names.
- Added Gateway and business service shells for user, product, seckill, order, payment, logistics, review, marketing, search recommendation, and AI.
- Added local `deploy/docker-compose.yml` and `.env.example` for MySQL, Redis, Nacos, and RocketMQ.
- Added frontend placeholder docs and phase-1 foundation documentation.
- Updated backend DevOps spec with the phase-1 local environment contract.

### Git Commits

| Hash | Message |
|------|---------|
| `2d4df65` | `feat: 新增项目的基础脚手架` |

### Testing

- [OK] `mvn -q -DskipTests compile` passed.
- [WARN] `mvn -q test` and `mvn -q -DskipTests package` were blocked in the Codex sandbox by access to `C:\Users\CodexSandboxOffline\.m2\repository`.

### Status

[OK] **Completed**

### Next Steps

- Run local verification outside the sandbox if Maven can access the normal local repository.
- Start the next task only after deciding which business domain should be implemented first.
